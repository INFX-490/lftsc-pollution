MUST BE DONE BEFORE PRESENTED TO CGI

Easier Stuff:

*fix hover over; should not be black but a grey-ish, silver color

*fix back to top and scroll button not working after initial click

*decide if orange color is necessary

*fix mobile map and menu formatting

*lower initial heading on front page slightly to be in the darker areas of the picture; instead of on the border between the sky

*feedback page is still not functional

*cleanup faq and about texts descriptions and information

*retrieve better pictures for charts on charts page; currently not consistent in size, with weird artifact borders on top left side

*description on charts page to describe purpose and concept

*Better formatting for feedback page

*Back-to-top button doesn't work at all on index.html

*fix feedback button; move to bottom of page and remove from navbar?

*layer charts on charts page better; side-by-side?

*fix charts on charts page formatting; do we want the border box?

*short description above map to tell users what it is?

*does about page need something more? Image? border around boxes?

*Add back in main.min.css? Remove altogether?


Harder Stuff:

*Get node.js "ejs" working to allow for partial header/footer files to remove repeated code; attempted code at this in LFTSC-59 repo

*Include vendor/js dependencies in node.js so that files no longer need to be included in git repo


Anything else?
